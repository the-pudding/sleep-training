His article <a href=https://www.askdrsears.com/topics/health-concerns/fussy-baby/science-excessive-crying-harmful target=_blank>Is Excessive Crying Harmful?</a> poses the question of whether, “Infants who endure many nights or weeks of crying-it-out…may have permanent implications on the development of sections of their brain?” Here’s a terrifying quote from the article that parents researching sleep training might come across in their own research:"},{"text":"<blockquote>“Research has shown that infants who are routinely separated from parents in a stressful way have abnormally high levels of the stress hormone cortisol, as well as lower growth hormone levels.
