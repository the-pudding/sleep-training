review,No Position,Behavioral sleep interventions in the first six months of life do not improve outcomes for mothers or infants: a systematic review,"Pamela S Douglas, Peter S Hill",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24042081/,United Kingdom,2013,0,109,yes,2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,"From Kempler: The Douglas and Hill review differs in some important ways from the current study.
